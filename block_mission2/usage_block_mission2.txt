Mission usage:
Include the contents of the desired sets with your mission's .fpk and .fpkd. 
Include the contents of the _fpk folders with your mission's _fpk and the contents of the _fpkd folders with your mission's _fpkd.

The common folder's "corpse" DataSet will define the enemy soldier corpse GameObject, expecting the location's default .parts to already be loaded, and 8 GameObjectLocators.
The common folder's "reinforce" DataSet will define the reinforce block ScriptBlockData, a vehicle GameObjectLocator, a driver and four more extra enemy soldier GameObjectLocators.

You can remove DataSets as you please, but the _fpk's .frl and the .fpkd's .frld, the rail and rail data files, must be included together or not included at all.
Their parallel in-.fpk and in-.fpkd paths not matching or only one of them existing will lead to an infinite loading screen on restart from checkpoint.

"combat" .trap files in .fpks usually contain trigger traps related to combat locators.

There still exist "animal" DataSets, but they're always empty, meaning they've become depricated.
The "combat" DataSets contain guard targets, their aim point locators, combat locators, combat locator sets, and sometimes, combat locator GeoTraps.
The "item" DataSets contain GameObjectLocators of pickable and placed items, such as ammo, weapons, and mines.
The "route" DataSets contain the GameObjectLocator of the command post.
The "trap" DataSets contain various GeoTraps, such as the checkpoint rings around an outpost, minefields, or the intel telop GeoTraps.
The "quiet" DataSets contain snipe point locators for the buddy Quiet.
